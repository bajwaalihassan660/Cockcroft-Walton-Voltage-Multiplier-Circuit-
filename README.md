Cockcroft-Walton Voltage Multiplier Circuit for Cable Testing
I designed a Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier circuit for testing cables. This project involved constructing a voltage multiplier circuit using capacitors and diodes arranged in a ladder configuration. The circuit was designed to generate high-voltage outputs suitable for testing insulation and continuity in cables. I optimized component values and configurations to achieve desired voltage levels for accurate testing. This project enhanced my skills in high-voltage circuit design, component selection, and practical application of electrical testing methodologies.
